## About Me

I'm a passionate Machine Learning and Data Science enthusiast, deeply engaged with advanced concepts like deep learning, neural networks, and predictive analytics. My expertise extends to applying these techniques in practical, real-world scenarios, continually pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this field.

## What I Do

- **Machine Learning**: Love to explore, create and employ sophisticated models, my recent accomplishment includes developing a **Dog-Breed Recognition Model using TensorFlow** and **Food-Vision Model with PyTorch**. 
- **Continued Learning**: Currently, I am diving deeper into Machine Learning with a focus on mastering **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**, enhancing my skills with MLOps in building and deploying more advanced models.
- **Programming Languages**: Skilled in Python, JavaScript (for web development and data scripting), HTML, CSS, and SQL.
- **Data Science Libraries**: Well-versed in a variety of libraries including **Scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **Matplotlib**, **NumPy**, and more, which I utilize for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## My Goals

I am a dedicated learner and problem solver, I am always exploring new technologies and methodologies in data science. My primary goal is to make a significant impact in the field, sharing my knowledge with others through my Personal Brand **X&R**.

## Connect With Me

I'm open to collaborations, discussions, and opportunities in projects connected to Machine Learning and Data Science. Feel free to reach out!
